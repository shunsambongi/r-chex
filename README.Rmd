## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("shunsambongi/chex")
```

## Example

`check_that()` takes an object you want to check, and a number of checks to 
run against the object. A check is usually a function that takes the object as 
the first argument and returns a boolean value of whether the check passed 
(`TRUE`) or failed (`FALSE`).

```{r}
library(chex)
library(magrittr)

results <- mtcars %>%
  check_that(
    is.data.frame, # this should PASS
    is.character,  # this should FAIL
  )

print(results)
```
